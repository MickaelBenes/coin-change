# coin-change "project"

Just 2 little algorithms that I was asked to do on the (apparently) classic "Coin change problem", but with limited number of coins.
Coins used are Euros.

1. Do coin change with minimum coins (OK)
2. Do coin change with maximum coins (OK)

The app is pretty simple, you insert a price, then the money. It calculates the change to return and displays the coins returned.
